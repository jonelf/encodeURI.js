# encodeURI.js
URI encoding module for Node.js with support for encoding.

There are [other](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urlencode) URL [encoders](https://github.com/alsotang/urlencode) that supports encoding but I couldn't find one that honors the Unreserved Characters in [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.3).
